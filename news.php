      <h1>The Spirit of Skye Festival</h1>
      <h2>may 16, 2017</h2>
      <p>We are delighted to be involved in a brand-new festival which is arriving in the Isle of Skye this summer. The Spirit of Skye brings together Scotland’s finest whisky, gin, beer, music and food. Featuring major drinks brands, local experts, creative masterclasses, ceilidhs, live music, local produce and Scotland's finest chefs. Whether you’re a drinks connoisseur, a food lover or simply looking for a good time with friends, there’s something for everybody at the Spirit of Skye.
      The Cuillin Brewery will be hosting two masterclasses at the event, so if you'd like to learn a little more about the process of brewing with a little sampling session, be sure to book your spot.</p>

      <h1>Concert in a Coire</h1>
      <h2>May 16, 2017</h2>
      <p>Last month, we were thrilled to be a part of a truly unique event. ‘A Concert in a Coire’ was a collaboration between musicians, designers and mountaineers - a gathering in Coire Lagan in the heart of the Cuillin, incorporating a musical performance, a guided hillwalk and a midnight feast of local island produce and some Cuillin Brewery Ale to round things off nicely. This was an atmospheric, and beautiful evening which we were delighted to be involved in. Let's hope for similar gatherings in the future.
